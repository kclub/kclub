		<div class="paraTitle">CRAN</div>
        <p>Our first link takes you to CRAN, the home of R. Style guides, packages, and other R tutorials can be found here. This is also where you download R, in addition you can find the latest alpha and beta releases here too.</p><br />
			<div class="paraTitle">Style Guides</div>
		 <p>The second link takes to you to CRANs R style guide. Although a strong and well put together style guide, we will be going with the guide published by Google(Out third link.) We went with Google's guide for a few reasons. Firstly we liked how google layed out spacing rules better than CRANs guide. We also liked how Google guide feels more digestible, CRANs guide is much larger which we felt could open us up to having a obscure formating error. Lastly from what we gathered Google's guide seems to be far and away more popular.</p></br>
		  <div class="paraTitle">Using R for Introductory Statistics</div>
		  <p>The fourth Link takes you to the web version of "Using R for Introductory Statistics" By John Verzani. We chose this because it was something we all were already familiar with having used it previously in 2600. The book covers the basics fairly well, with examples and some problems for you to try on your own. All in all it seems like a solid tutorial for us to follow through with.</p><br />
		  <div class="paraTitle">Cyclismo Tutorial</div>
		  <p>The fifth link is to Cyclismo, written by Kelly Black. We ended up choosing this website because it's layout allows you to quickly find what you are trying to learn by breaking things down to sub-categories. Although the guide is a little on the small side, it's much faster using this then flipping through a book. </p><br />
		  <div class="paraTitle">Codeschool Tutorial</div>
		  <p>The sixth and final link is to Codeschool. Codeschool in our experience make great tutorials on a multitude of different programming languages. The interactive web elements make this a cool and intuitive web based R tutorial. The tutorials are inline with the website, and the purpose for what you are doing is very clear.</p><br />
